# AI-Driven Government Simulation

## Overview
This project is a **government simulation** using AI agents to emulate decision-making in a democratic system. The simulation uses **p5.js** for rendering and animations, and GPT-powered agents to model the roles of legislators, executives, and judicial representatives. Policies are proposed, debated, amended, and voted on in a process inspired by real-world democratic systems.

The simulation provides an interactive way to visualize and understand the complexities of collaborative governance, powered by AI.

## Features
- **Dynamic AI Agents**: Agents representing legislative, executive, and judicial branches, each with unique priorities and behaviors.
- **Policy Simulation**: Agents propose, debate, and amend policies based on their roles and party values.
- **Visual Feedback**: Animations for policy movement between agents and dynamic color changes based on simulation states.
- **Interactive Decisions**: Realistic responses from agents using OpenAI's GPT-based API for contextual reasoning.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust priorities, agent roles, and debate lengths.
